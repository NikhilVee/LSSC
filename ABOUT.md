# ABOUT

The Laurier Ski and Snowboard Club (LSSC) seeks to promote the sport of Skiing and Snowboarding to the university body. We invite participants of all skills levels to join us on our weekly excursions to explore local mountains and our one big trip Reading Week Trip to world-class resorts in Canada during the winter season. LSSC is an excellent way to break away from studying to stay active and to meet new people with similar interests. 

### WANT TO GET INVOLVED?

We are looking for passionate executives and volunteers to help around with the club. If you are a student and want to get involved on campus, this is a great opportunity to do so! Email us at laurierskiboard@gmail.com with some basic information about yourself and why you want to join. We will promptly get back to you and see how you can fit with our team.
